      description: |
        This endpoint is used to create a new log stream within Parseable.  
        A **log stream** is a group of similar logs. For example, you can create a log stream for a specific application's logs, another log stream for your database logs, and so on. You can create as many log streams as needed to organize and manage logs efficiently.

        This endpoint is used to delete an existing log stream.
        When a log stream is deleted, all associated data is permanently removed.

        **Log Ingestion API via Stream Endpoint**  
        In this approach, you need to create a stream first using the **Create Stream API**.  
        Once the stream is created, you can send logs to the stream ingestion API endpoint:  
        **http://demo.parseable.com/api/v1/logstream/otellogs**  
        This API does not require any headers for specifying the stream name.

        **Parseable Log Query API**  
        This endpoint allows you to query logs using PostgreSQL syntax.  
        
        The query API accepts the following parameters:
        - **query**: The SQL query to execute (required)
        - **startTime**: The start time for the query range (optional)
        - **endTime**: The end time for the query range (optional)
        - **streamName**: The name of the log stream to query (required)
        
        Example request body:
        ```json
        {
          "query": "SELECT * FROM log WHERE log ILIKE '%error%';",
          "startTime": "2023-01-01 00:00:00.000000",
          "endTime": "2023-01-01 23:59:59.999999",
          "streamName": "example-stream"
        }

        **Log Ingestion API via Custom Headers**  
        This approach allows you to send logs to Parseable using custom headers to specify the target stream.  
        
        Required headers:
        - **X-PBL-Stream**: The name of the stream to ingest logs into
        
        The API accepts logs in JSON format. You can send single log entries or arrays of log entries.
        
        Example:
        ```json
        {
          "level": "info",
          "message": "User logged in",
          "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
          "user_id": "user123"
        }
        ```
        
        Or as an array:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "level": "info",
            "message": "User logged in",
            "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
            "user_id": "user123"
          },
          {
            "level": "error",
            "message": "Failed to process request",
            "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:01:00Z",
            "error_code": "ERR-1001"
          }
        ]
        ```
