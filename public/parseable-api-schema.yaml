        This endpoint is used to create a new log stream within Parseable.  
        A **log stream** is a group of similar logs. For example, you can create a log stream for a specific application's logs, another log stream for your database logs, and so on. You can create as many log streams as needed to organize and manage logs efficiently.

        **Log Ingestion API via Stream Endpoint**  
        In this approach, you need to create a stream first using the **Create Stream API**.  
        Once the stream is created, you can send logs to the stream ingestion API endpoint:  
        **http://demo.parseable.com/api/v1/logstream/otellogs**  
        This API does not require any headers for specifying the stream name.

        **Parseable Log Query API**  
        The Parseable log query API allows you to query logs in real-time using **standard PostgreSQL syntax**.  
        To retrieve logs, the API requires **startTime** and **endTime** parameters. 

        #### Timezone and Format
        All timestamps are considered in UTC timezone.  
        The timestamp format should be: **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff**  

        #### Request Body Parameters
        - **query**: The query string (mandatory).
        - **startTime**: Start time for the query (mandatory).
        - **endTime**: End time for the query (mandatory).
        - **streamName**: Name of the log stream (mandatory).

        #### Example Request
        ```json
        {
          "query": "SELECT * FROM log WHERE log ILIKE '%error%';",
          "startTime": "2023-01-01 00:00:00.000000",
          "endTime": "2023-01-01 23:59:59.999999",
