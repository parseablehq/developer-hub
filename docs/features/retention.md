### How it works
Parseable allows setting the retention, or the amount of time that log data is kept in the system, for each log stream. The time can be set to a multiple of 1 day. Note that retention works at a stream level, and each stream can have a different retention period. Also, you can only set a single log stream per retention period.

### Setting up
You can set Retention via the Stream Management page (Stream >> Manage >> Retention). If you're using external applications to interact with Parseable, you can also use the retention API calls. Refer to the API documentation for details.

### Configuration
Here is sample retention configuration, with all the available options.

```json
[
    {
        "duration": "20d",
        "action": "delete",
        "description": "delete logs after 20 days"
    }
]
```
This table explains the configuration options.
