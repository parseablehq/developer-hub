Parseable offers realtime alerting based on contents of incoming events. Each dataset can have several alerts and each alert is evaluated independently.

## Alert Types

Parseable supports three types of alerts:

### Threshold Alerts

Threshold alerts trigger when a metric crosses a defined boundary. For example, alerting when response time exceeds 500ms or when error count is greater than 100.

### Anomaly Detection

<Callout type="info">
  <EnterpriseBadge /> This feature requires an Enterprise license.
</Callout>

Anomaly Detection alerts use machine learning to identify unusual patterns in your data. These alerts automatically detect deviations from normal behavior without requiring you to set specific thresholds.

### Forecasting

<Callout type="info">
  <EnterpriseBadge /> This feature requires an Enterprise license.
</Callout>

Forecasting alerts predict future values based on historical data and alert you if the predicted values are expected to cross your defined limits. This helps you proactively address issues before they occur.
