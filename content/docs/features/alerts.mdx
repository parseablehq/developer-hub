Parseable offers realtime alerting based on contents of incoming events. Each dataset can have several alerts and each alert is evaluated independently.

## How it works

Alerts in Parseable work by monitoring your log data in real-time and triggering notifications when specific conditions are met. Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. **Define conditions**: You set up rules that specify what to look for in your logs (like error codes, specific text patterns, or threshold values)
2. **Automatic monitoring**: Parseable continuously checks incoming logs against these rules
3. **Notification**: When a rule condition is met, Parseable sends notifications to your configured targets (like Slack or a webhook)

You can easily set up alerts through Parseable's user interface called Prism, which provides a simple way to configure all aspects of your alerts without writing complex code.

### What are targets?

Targets in Parseable alerts are the destinations where notifications are sent when an alert is triggered. Each alert can be configured to send notifications to multiple targets simultaneously. A target can be a notification service like Slack, a webhook endpoint, or an alert management system like Alertmanager.

When an alert condition is met, Parseable sends the alert message to all the targets specified in the alert configuration. Each target has its own configuration parameters, such as endpoint URLs, authentication credentials, and notification frequency settings.

### Configuration

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs'

<Tabs items={['Prism', 'API']}>
  <Tab value="Prism">
    You can configure alerts via the Prism UI. Follow these steps:
    
    1. Navigate to the Alerts page from the side navigation menu
    2. Click on "Create Alert" to set up a new alert
    3. Fill in the required fields (name, message, rule conditions, and targets)
    4. Save your configuration
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="API">
When configuring alerts via API, you'll need to understand how to use the `aggregates` key properly. This key is essential for defining the conditions that trigger your alerts based on aggregated data.  

#### Understanding Aggregation Configuration

The `aggregates` key describes the aggregations to be applied to the result of the SQL in `query`. Each aggregation consists of these components:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aggregateFunction` | The function to apply (`avg`, `sum`, `count`, `min`, `max`) |
| `column` | The column to apply the function to |
| `operator` | Comparison operator (`>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`) |
| `value` | The threshold value to compare against |
| `conditions` | Additional filtering conditions (similar to SQL WHERE clauses) |

#### Condition Limits

Parseable imposes these limits on aggregation conditions:

- Maximum of two conditions per aggregate config object
- Conditions must be joined by either `AND` or `OR` (specified in the `operator` field)
- Each condition can only compare a single column to a single value

#### Example 1: Single Condition

Consider this base query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM backend_logs
```

To create an alert when the average latency exceeds 200ms for successful calls (status=200):

```json
"aggregateConfig":[
  {
    "aggregateFunction": "avg",
    "column": "latency",
    "operator": ">",
    "value": "200",
    "conditions": {
      "operator": null,
      "conditionConfig": [
        {
          "column": "status",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "200"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Example 2: Multiple Conditions with AND

To alert when average latency exceeds 200ms for successful calls (status=200) AND a specific user:

```json
"aggregateConfig": [
  {
    "aggregateFunction": "avg",
    "column": "latency",
    "operator": ">",
    "value": "200",
    "conditions": {
      "operator": "and",
      "conditionConfig": [
        {
          "column": "status",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "200"
        },
        {
          "column": "user_id",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "someUserID"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Example 3: Multiple Conditions with OR

To alert when the count of errors exceeds 5 for either 4xx or 5xx status codes:

```json
"aggregateConfig": [
  {
    "aggregateFunction": "count",
    "column": "*",
    "operator": ">",
    "value": "5",
    "conditions": {
      "operator": "or",
      "conditionConfig": [
        {
          "column": "status",
          "operator": "like",
          "value": "4%"
        },
        {
          "column": "status",
          "operator": "like",
          "value": "5%"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



### **Supported targets**

Parseable supports sending alerts to Webhook, Slack, and Alertmanager targets. You can configure multiple targets for each alert.

#### **Target Configuration**

Targets are the destinations where notifications are sent when an alert is triggered. The targets field is an array of target objects, each with the following common parameters:

| Variable Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | Yes | The name of target. |
| type | Yes | The type of target. Can be alertmanager, webhook, or slack. |
| endpoint | Yes | The URL of the target. |
| notificationConfig | No | Specify the frequency of sending the alert to the target. By default the `notificationConfig` field has interval set to 1 (minute) and times set to 1. `interval` accepts a `u64` and `times` accepts a `usize`. If you want the notification to be sent 5 times, once every minute, you would set `interval` to 1 and `times` to 5. |

Sample target configuration:

```json
{
    "name":"AlertManagerTarget",
    "type": "alertManager",
    "endpoint": "https://some.webhook.com",
    "username": "username",
    "password":"password",
    "skipTlsCheck": true,
    "notificationConfig": {
        "interval": 3,
        "times": 7
    }
}
```

Apart from above common parameters, there are target-specific parameters that can be configured. Refer to the sections below for details.

#### **Alertmanager**

The alertmanager target can be used to send notifications to [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) instance. Note that by default if you don't provide repeat configuration for this then Parseable will continue to send alerts to Alertmanager while it is active.

Note that Alertmanager expects clients to continuously re-send alerts as long as they are still active (usually on the order of 30 seconds to 3 minutes). Avoid specifying `repeat.times` in configuration unless you want Parseable to stop re-sending alerts after specified number of times.

| Variable Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| endpoint | Yes | The URL of the Alertmanager api to send notifications to. Compatible with Alertmanager API V2 |
| username | No | Username for basic auth. See [Prometheus Docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/https/#http-traffic) on how to setup basic auth. |
| password | No | Password for basic auth. |
| skipTlsCheck | No | Whether to skip TLS verification when sending the alert to Alertmanager. |

Example JSON sent by Parseable to Alertmanager. Note that `rule_config_*` may differ depending on the type of rule that triggered the alert.

```json
{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "Status Alert",
        "deployment_id": "01GTFFFFFFFFFFFF",
        "rule_config_column": "status",
        "rule_config_operator": "exact",
        "rule_config_repeats": "2",
        "rule_config_value": "500",
        "rule_type": "column",
        "status": "firing",
        "stream": "app"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "message": "message that was set for this alert",
        "reason": "status column was equal to 500, 2 times"
    }
}
```

#### **Webhook**

The webhook target can be used to send notifications to a webhook URL. The target object contains the following parameters:

| Variable Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| endpoint | Yes | The URL of the webhook to send notifications to. |
| headers | No | Any custom headers to include in the webhook request |
| skipTlsCheck | No | Whether to skip TLS verification when sending the webhook request. |

#### **Slack**

The slack target can be used to send notifications to a Slack channel. The target object contains the following parameters:

| Variable Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| endpoint | Yes | Slack webhook URL. Refer [Slack docs for details](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). |

#### **Alert Configuration Fields**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Should be `v1` for now |
| `severity` | Either `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| `title` | The title of the alert |
| `stream` | The dataset on which the alert is being configured |
| `alertType` | Should be `threshold` for now |
| `targets` | An array of target IDs to which the notification will be sent |

#### **Evaluation Configuration**

`evalConfig` - For now the `evalConfig` is set to `rollingWindow`

* `rollingWindow` - This is the only supported evaluation type for now. The start time and end time keep moving constantly
  * `evalStart` - The start time for evaluation. Should be of `humantime` type
  * `evalEnd` - Should be `now`
  * `evalFrequency` - An integer describing after how many minutes should an evaluation be run
