title: Role Based Access Control
---

Parseable provides a comprehensive Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and access to resources.

## Key Concepts

- **Actions**: Each API corresponds to an Action on the Parseable server
- **Privileges**: Groups of allowed actions (Admin, Editor, Writer, Reader, Ingester)
- **Resources**: Log datasets that can be assigned to roles
- **Roles**: Named entities with privileges and resources assigned
- **Users**: Human or machine entities that can perform actions

<Callout type="info">
User passwords are hashed and stored securely. Parseable does not store passwords in plain text.
</Callout>

## Built-in Privileges

| Privilege | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Full access to all endpoints and management functions |
| **Editor** | Full access to datasets but cannot manage users or view cluster details |
| **Writer** | Can ingest data and manage alerts/retention on assigned datasets |
| **Reader** | Read-only access to assigned datasets |
| **Ingester** | Can only ingest data to assigned datasets |

## Key Features

- **Resource-level permissions** - Assign privileges to specific datasets
- **Tag-based filtering** - Restrict access to events with specific tags
- **Multi-role support** - Users can have multiple roles assigned
- **OIDC integration** - Automatic role assignment from identity provider groups
