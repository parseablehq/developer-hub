## Introduction
Parseable Observability Platform supports full-text search allowing users to quickly find relevant log data with ease. Parseableâ€™s search engine is optimized for low-latency queries directly on object storage.

You can perform full-text searches using both the Parseable API and the Prism UI, providing flexibility for automation and interactive exploration.
