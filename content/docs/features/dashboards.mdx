Parseable Dashboards are customizable and support querying multiple data streams for comprehensive insights. You can also leverage text to SQL conversion for quick query creation.

## Adding Charts to Dashboards

Charts can be added to dashboards from multiple sources:

- **SQL Editor**: Run queries in the SQL editor, visualize results, and add charts directly to dashboards
- **Keystone**: AI-generated insights can be added as dashboard tiles
- **Chart Builder**: Build visualizations using the built-in chart builder

## Chart Builder Types

There are two ways to build charts:

### 1. SQL Editor
Write custom SQL queries, visualize the results, and add them to your dashboard. Supports up to 3 datasets simultaneously for complex joins and comparative analysis.

### 2. Visual Chart Builder
Use the point-and-click interface to select chart type, dataset, fields, and styling without writing SQL.
