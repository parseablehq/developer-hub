## Introduction
Parseable Dashboards are customisable and support querying multiple data streams for comprehensive insights. You can also leverage text to SQL conversion for quick query creation. The Dashboards feature is designed to help you visualize data insights at a glance, enabling you to make informed decisions based on real-time data.

## How it works

Dashboards in Parseable are a collection of tiles, each representing a visualization of a query result. You can create multiple tiles on a dashboard, each with its own query and chart type. Further, a tile's chart can be configured for different colors, units and formatting. Each tile can be based on a query targeting different dataset. The tiles can be resized, repositioned, and exported in various formats for easy sharing and collaboration.

Dashboard tiles can be dragged and repositioned anywhere on the dashboard. You can also adjust the tile size to fit your layout preferences, selecting from small, medium, large, or full screen widths (1/4, 2/4, 3/4, and full screen).

## Visualizations

Currently, Parseable has six types of visualizations:

- Circular charts (donut and pie).
- Area graphs.
- Bar graphs.
- Line graphs.
- Simple table.

Each visualization comes with its own customization options, allowing you to adjust colors, orientation, types, and tick formatting to fit your preferences.

## Time Range

Set a fixed time range for your dashboard to ensure all tiles load data consistently. You can save this time range with the dashboard, allowing for synchronized data views across all visualizations.

## How to create a dashboard

- Navigate to `/dashboards`.
- Click on `Create Dashboard`.
- Fill in the name and description and click `Create`.

You can also import predefined dashboard templates or use a dashboard configuration downloaded from Parseable.

## How to create a tile

- Select any dashboard & click `Add Tile`.

- Enter a name and description (optional) for the tile.

- Write your SQL query and validate it (ensure the query returns data).

- Edit the visualization settings as desired.

- Click `Save` to apply the changes.

### Exporting a Tile

You can export a tile in multiple formats, including high-resolution PNG, JSON, or CSV.

## Dashboard import & exports

You can import and export dashboards in JSON format. This feature allows you to share dashboards across different Parseable instances or with other users.

## Future Enhancements

### AI-Driven Dashboard Creation

Upcoming enhancements will allow for the automatic creation of dashboards by leveraging AI to read schemas and understand sample data, simplifying the setup process.

### Extended Support for Tick Formats

Currently, we support big numbers, sizes in bytes, and UTC timestamps for tick formatting functions. Future updates will expand support for additional tick formats, providing greater flexibility for data visualization. If you need specific tick formatting functions, please let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable/issues).

### Dashboard Templates

We are introducing support for predefined templates, ensuring stable configurations for common observability platforms. This feature facilitates the creation of dashboards with just a single click for popular systems, streamlining your setup process.

### Upgrades

If you use a version between `v1.5.1` to `v1.5.4`, there is a minor, one time manual intervention needed to ensure your old dashboards or filters are not lost. Please ensure to follow these steps before you upgrade to the latest version:

- Check in the storage (S3 or local) for any json files under `users/<username>/<dashboard_id.json>` and verify if version field says v2.

- Also check if dashboard with same dashboard_id is also available under `users/<sha256-hash-of-username>/<dashboard_id.json>` and verify if version is v3.

- If you find `v2` and `v3` versions of the files for same `dashboard_id`, please ensure to delete the old version (`v2`) of the json file.

Once all duplicate files are removed successfully, upgrade to the latest version of Parseable. Same applies for all the saved filters created.
