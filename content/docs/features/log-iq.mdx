Log IQ allows identifying the format of unstructured log data, transforming it into structured columns within ingested events in JSON format. This helps in easy and optimized query, search, debug and visualize the data.

## Key Benefits

- **Automatic format detection** - No need to separate datasets for each format
- **Pre-defined SQL queries** - Debug data with less effort
- **Dashboard templates** - Visualize ingested data automatically
- **Template-based alerts** - Reduce configuration efforts
- **AI-powered insights** - Fixed schema enables AI-generated alerts, dashboards, and filters

## Supported Formats

Log IQ supports 40+ log formats including:

- `access_log` - Web server access logs (Apache, Nginx)
- `alb_log` / `elb_log` - AWS Load Balancer logs
- `syslog_log` - Standard system logs
- `redis_log` - Redis database logs
- `haproxy_log` - HAProxy load balancer logs
- `s3_log` - AWS S3 access logs
- And many more...

## Roadmap

In the future, Parseable will provide pre-built dashboards, SQL queries, and alerts for all known log formats.
