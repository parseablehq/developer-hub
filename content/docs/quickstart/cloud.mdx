Get started with Parseable Cloud in minutes — no infrastructure to manage.

## Sign Up

1. Go to [app.parseable.com](https://app.parseable.com) and create an account
2. Verify your email address

## Create a Workspace

1. Click **Create Workspace**
2. Choose your preferred **region** (select the region closest to your data sources for best performance)
3. Wait a few minutes for your Parseable workspace to be provisioned

Once ready, you'll receive your unique **ingestion endpoint**.

## Start Ingesting Data

Use the endpoint provided to start sending logs. Here's an example using curl:

```bash
curl --location --request POST \
'https://<your-workspace>.parseable.com/api/v1/ingest' \
--header 'X-P-Stream: demo' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <your-credentials>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
    {
        "id": "434a5f5e-2f5f-11ed-a261-0242ac120002",
        "datetime": "2023-01-05T07:20:50.52Z",
        "host": "153.10.110.81",
        "message": "Hello from Parseable Cloud!"
    }
]'
```

Replace `<your-workspace>` and `<your-credentials>` with the values from your workspace dashboard.
