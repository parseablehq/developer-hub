## Run Parseable Locally

Running Parseable for the first time? You can get up and running in less than a minute with the Docker container. Run the following command to start Parseable in local mode on your machine:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
parseable/parseable:latest \
parseable local-store
```

Once the container is running successfully, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and login with the default credentials `admin` / `admin`.

You'll see the setup screen where you can import sample data in one click. This will also create few dashboards and queries to get you started.
