description: Learn how to send telemetry to Parseable from various applications and telemetry agents
---

Parseable supports ingesting telemetry from a wide variety of data sources. Whether you're sending telemetry directly from your applications or using popular log agents, Parseable provides flexible integration options to fit your logging infrastructure.

## Overview

There are two primary ways to send telemetry to Parseable:

1. **Direct Application Integration** - Send telemetry directly from your application code using HTTP APIs
2. **Telemetry Agents** - Use industry-standard telemetry collection agents to aggregate and forward telemetry

## Applications

Send telemetry directly from your applications using Parseable's HTTP API. This approach gives you fine-grained control over what gets logged and when. Parseable provides examples and guidance for popular programming languages:

- **[Python](/docs/datasource/applications/python)** - Send telemetry using Python's requests library
- **[JavaScript](/docs/datasource/applications/javascript)** - Integrate telemetry in Node.js and browser applications
- **[Go](/docs/datasource/applications/go)** - Use Go's native HTTP client for telemetry ingestion
- **[Java](/docs/datasource/applications/java)** - Send telemetry from Java applications
- **[Rust](/docs/datasource/applications/rust)** - Integrate Parseable in Rust applications
- **[C#](/docs/datasource/applications/csharp)** - Send telemetry from .NET applications

Each language guide includes examples for:
- Creating telemetry streams
- Sending telemetry events with custom metadata and tags
- Querying telemetry using SQL

## Log Agents

Use established log collection agents to aggregate telemetry from multiple sources and forward them to Parseable. This approach is ideal for:

- Collecting telemetry from multiple applications and services
- Aggregating system telemetry and container telemetry
- Processing and transforming telemetry before ingestion
- Implementing centralized telemetry architectures

Parseable integrates seamlessly with popular log agents:

- **[Fluent Bit](/docs/datasource/log-agents/fluent-bit)** - Lightweight and high-performance log processor
- **[Fluentd](/docs/datasource/log-agents/fluentd)** - Unified logging layer with extensive plugin ecosystem
- **[Vector](/docs/datasource/log-agents/vector)** - High-performance observability data pipeline
- **[OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/datasource/log-agents/otel-collector)** - Vendor-agnostic telemetry data collection
- **[Logstash](/docs/datasource/log-agents/logstash)** - Server-side data processing pipeline
- **[Syslog](/docs/datasource/log-agents/syslog)** - Traditional system logging protocol
- **[Apache Log4j](/docs/datasource/log-agents/apache-log-4j)** - Java-based logging utility

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Use Direct Application Integration When:
- You need fine-grained control over telemetry content and structure
- You want to minimize infrastructure dependencies
- You're building a new application or microservice
- You need to add custom metadata or tags at the application level

### Use Telemetry Agents When:
- You need to collect telemetry from multiple sources
- You want to aggregate container or system telemetry
- You need to transform or enrich telemetry before ingestion
- You're implementing a centralized telemetry strategy
- You want to buffer telemetry during network issues

## Next Steps

Choose your integration method and follow the corresponding guide:

- Browse the **[Applications](/docs/datasource/applications)** section for language-specific examples
- Explore the **[Log Agents](/docs/datasource/log-agents)** section for agent-specific configurations
