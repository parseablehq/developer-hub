title: "Logstash"
---

Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to variety of targets. Logstash can be configured to send logs to Parseable with [HTTP output plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html#output-http) and [JSON output format](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html#output-json).

This document explains how to set up Logstash to ship logs to Parseable in Docker Compose. We use Logstash's [generator](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html#input-generator) input plugin to generate sample log data. Then we use the [http](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html#output-http) output plugin to send these logs to Parseable.

## Docker Compose
Please ensure Docker Compose installed on your machine.


```bash
mkdir parseable
cd parseable
wget https://www.parseable.com/logstash/logstash.conf
wget https://www.parseable.com/logstash/docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up -d
```
You can now access the Parseable dashboard on `http://localhost:8000`. You should see a dataset called `logstashlogs` populated with log data generated by the [generator](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html#input-generator) input plugin.
