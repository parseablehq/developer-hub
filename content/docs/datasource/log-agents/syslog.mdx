syslog-ng allows you to collect, parse, classify, rewrite and correlate logs from across your infrastructure and store or route them to log analysis tools. syslog-ng implements syslog protocol for Unix and Unix-like systems. syslog-ng can be configured to send logs to Parseable with [HTTP forward](https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.37/administration-guide/40#TOPIC-1829058) and JSON output format.

This document explains how to set up syslog-ng to ship logs to Parseable. We use a demo application [Flog](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog) running in Docker Compose to generate logs.

### Docker Compose
Please ensure Docker Compose [installed on your machine](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


```bash
mkdir parseable
cd parseable
wget https://www.parseable.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
wget https://www.parseable.com/syslog-ng/docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up -d
```
You can now access the Parseable dashboard on `http://localhost:8000`. You should see a dataset called `demo` populated with log data generated by the [flog container](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog).
