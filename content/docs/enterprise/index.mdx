## Core infrastructure for mission-critical deployments

Core infrastructure projects, especially those that deal with data and need to guarantee data protection and reliability of the highest order, take time to build. Over the last 3 years while building ParseableDB, we've seen a wide range of edge cases, bug reports, weird behavior, and more.

The time is right to create an enterprise-grade offering, built on the solid foundation of AGPLv3 ParseableDB. With a dedicated, well-defined Enterprise offering, we'll be able to serve serious, mission-critical users much better, while improving the sustainability of the OSS product. It helps us derive some value from our work without pulling the rug from under the community.

**Sustainable open source. No drama. No bait-and-switch. Just fast, efficient, observability.**
