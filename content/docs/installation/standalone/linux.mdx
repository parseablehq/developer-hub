This page explains the steps required to setup a systemd service for Parseable server in both S3 and local store mode.

<Callout type="warn">
The local store mode is recommended for testing purposes only. For production use, we recommend using S3 storage.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Parseable binary is available at `/usr/local/bin/`. Download the relevant binary from the release page.

## Create configuration

```bash
cat <<EOT >> /etc/default/parseable
P_USERNAME="parseable"
P_PASSWORD="parseable"
P_ADDR="0.0.0.0:8000"
P_STAGING_DIR="/var/lib/parseable/staging"
P_FS_DIR="/var/lib/parseable/data"
EOT
```

You can add additional environment variables to the `/etc/default/parseable` file as needed. For example, for memory and cpu thresholds you can set `P_MEMORY_THRESHOLD` and `P_CPU_THRESHOLD` environment variables as `100`. By default, the memory and cpu thresholds are set to `80%`.

Download `parseable.local.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```bash
( cd /etc/systemd/system/; curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parseablehq/parseable/main/systemd/parseable.local.service )
```

### Start/Stop the service

Once the service file is created, reload the systemd daemon and start the service.

```bash
systemctl enable parseable.local.service
service parseable start
```

You can check the status of the service using the following command.

```bash
service parseable status
```

You can now access Parseable at the address `http://localhost:8000` (default configuration). If you added `P_ADDR` to the config file, please access the correct URL accordingly.

To check logs, use `journalctl`, like:

```bash
journalctl -eu parseable.local.service
```

If you want to disable / uninstall Parseable, run the below command.

```bash
systemctl disable parseable.local.service
```

## Setup Parseable with S3 Storage

Prerequisites
- Parseable binary is available at `/usr/local/bin/`. Download the relevant binary from the [release page](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable/releases).
- S3 or compatible object store URL, access key, secret key, and bucket name to be used as storage.

## Create configuration

Please ensure to replace the placeholders with the relevant values.

```bash
cat <<EOT >> /etc/default/parseable
P_USERNAME=<username>
P_PASSWORD=<password>
P_ADDR="0.0.0.0:8000"
P_STAGING_DIR="/var/lib/parseable/staging"
P_S3_BUCKET=<s3-bucket>
P_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<access-key>
P_S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>
P_S3_REGION=<region>
P_S3_URL="https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com"
EOT
```

Download `parseable.s3.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system/
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parseablehq/parseable/main/systemd/parseable.s3.service
```

### Start/Stop the service
Once the service file is created, reload the systemd daemon and start the service.

```bash
systemctl enable parseable.s3.service
service parseable start
```

You can check the status of the service using the following command.

```bash
service parseable status
```

You can now access Parseable at the address `http://localhost:8000` (default configuration). If you added `P_ADDR` to the config file, please access the correct URL accordingly.

To check logs, use `journalctl`, like:

```bash
journalctl -eu parseable.s3.service
```

In case you want to disable or uninstall Parseable, run the below given command.

```bash
systemctl disable parseable.s3.service
```
