This document explains how to set up Parseable in standalone mode on Docker with `s3-store` mode. This mode is used to store logs on S3 or compatible object storage.

## Prerequisites
- S3 or a compatible object storage URL.
- Credentials to read / write access the object storage.
- Bucket created on object storage.
- Docker is now installed on your machine. Refer to [this doc](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to install Docker if you haven't already.

## Setup env file
We'll create an env file with all the config fields for Parseable. Use the command below to create the file. Note that fields need to be set after you create the file.

```bash
cat << EOF > parseable-env
P_STAGING_DIR=/staging
P_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8000
P_USERNAME=<username-to-be-set-for-parseable>
P_PASSWORD=<password-to-be-set-for-parseable>
P_S3_URL=<s3-url>
P_S3_BUCKET=<s3-bucket>
P_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<access-key>
P_S3_SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>
P_S3_REGION=<region>
EOF
```

## Run Parseable

Parseable needs a local directory for staging log data, before sending it to object storage (configurable via `P_STAGING_DIR` field in the env file). Assuming you've set the `P_STAGING_DIR` field to `/staging` and want to mount that volume to a local path `/parseable/staging`, run the below command.

```bash
mkdir /parseable/staging

docker run \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file parseable-env \
  -v /parseable/staging:/staging \
  containers.parseable.com/parseable/parseable:latest \
  parseable s3-store
```

<Callout type="info">
Since Parseable runs as user parseable inside the container, you'll need to make sure that the local path /data/parseable is owned by user parseable (`uid: 10001`). You can do that by running `chown -R 10001:10001 /data/parseable` on the host machine.
</Callout>

## Access Parseable
Once Parseable is up and running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8000` (assuming you've set `P_ADDR` to `:8000` in the env file). Credentials to login to Parseable are set via `P_USERNAME` and `P_PASSWORD` fields in the env file.

## Troubleshoot
### Running docker on AWS EC2
When trying to fetch credentials over IMDSv2 inside a docker container the client can hang indefinitely. This can happen due to AWS not allowing more than 1 hop in IMDSv2 endpoint response. You can change this configuration, please refer to the consideration section of [retrieve instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#imds-considerations).
