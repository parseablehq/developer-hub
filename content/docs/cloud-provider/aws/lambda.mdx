### Overview
Parseable AWS Lambda extension is a Lambda extension that allows you to send logs from your Lambda functions to your Parseable instance.

### Usage
To use the parseable-lambda-extension with a lambda function, it must be configured as a layer. There are two variants of the extension available: one for x86_64 architecture and one for arm64 architecture.

You can add the extension as a layer with the AWS CLI tool:


```bash
$ aws lambda update-code-configuration \
  --function-name MyAwesomeFunction
  --layers "<layer version ARN>"
```
The extension's layer version ARN follows the pattern below.


```bash
# Layer Version ARN Pattern
arn:aws:lambda:<AWS_REGION>:724973952305:layer:parseable-lambda-extension-<ARCH>-<VERSION>:1
```

- AWS_REGION - This must match the region of the Lambda function to which you are adding the extension.

- ARCH - `x86_64` or `arm64`.

- VERSION - The version of the extension you want to use. Current version is v1.0. For current latest release `v1.0`, use the value `v1-0`.

### Configuration
The extension is configurable via environment variables set for your lambda function.

- `PARSEABLE_LOG_URL` - Parseable endpoint URL. It should be set to `https://<parseable-url>/api/v1/ingest`. Change `<parseable-url>` to your Parseable instance URL. (required)

- `PARSEABLE_USERNAME` - Username set for your Parseable instance. (required)

- `PARSEABLE_PASSWORD` - Password set for your Parseable instance. (required)

- `PARSEABLE_LOG_STREAM` - Parseable stream name where you want to ingest logs. (default: `Lambda Function Name`).

Refer [Parseable installation documentation](/docs/installation/) for more details.

### Container image lambda
In case if you deploy your lambda as container image, to inject extension as part of your function just copy it to your image:


```bash
FROM parseable/aws-lambda-extension:latest AS parseable-extension
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.8
# Layer code
WORKDIR /opt
COPY --from=parseable-extension /opt/ .
# Function code
WORKDIR /var/task
COPY app.py .
CMD app.lambda_handler 
```
