Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services provider, offering a wide range of services including compute, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more. Parseable integrates with AWS to provide a seamless experience for our customers.

This document provides an overview of the AWS services that Parseable integrates with, and how to set up the integration.
