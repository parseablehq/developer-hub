### Service Bus Messages
Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise integration message broker. Service Bus is most commonly used to decouple applications and services from each other, and is a reliable and secure platform for asynchronous data and state transfer.    

Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing the following benefits:

- Load-balancing work across competing workers

- Safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries

- Coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability

### Overview
You can send messages published to Azure Service Bus Queue to Parseable [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview) service.

We'll use the Azure Logic Apps trigger "When a message is received in a queue" to send message to Parseable.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following:

- Parseable deployed and running in your environment. Refer the [installation guide](/docs/installation/) for more information.

- Active Azure subscription with Service Bus namespace and queue created. Refer the [Azure Service Bus documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) for more information.



### Use Azure Logic Apps to send Service Bus messages to Parseable
- Navigate to the Azure Logic Apps in the Azure portal.

- Click on the `+ Add` button to create a new Logic App.

- Configure the Logic App to trigger when an message is available in the Message queue. Refer the image below for more information. We have used the `When a message is received in a queue` trigger to start the Logic App.
