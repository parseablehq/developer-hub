### Configure Alert Rules

Configure the alert rules for all alert types:

- **Dataset**: Select the log stream or dataset you want to monitor
- **Monitor**: Choose the specific field to track (e.g., `response_time`, `error_count`, `status_code`)
- **Filter** (Optional): Add conditions to narrow down the data (e.g., `status = 500`, `environment = production`)
- **Group By** (Optional): Group results by specific fields for more granular alerting (e.g., group by `service_name` or `region`)

### Configure Targets

Targets are the destinations where notifications are sent when an alert is triggered. Parseable supports Webhook, Slack, and Alertmanager targets.

The list of configured targets can be seen under Settings > Alert Targets.
