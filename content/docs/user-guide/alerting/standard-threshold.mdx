## Threshold Alerts

Get notified when a metric crosses a set limit.

### Configuration

- **Evaluate the last**: Time window to analyze (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day)
- **Repeat evaluation every**: How often to check the condition (e.g., every 10 minutes)
- **Trigger when result is**: Set the comparison operator (`>`, `<`, `=`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`) and threshold value
