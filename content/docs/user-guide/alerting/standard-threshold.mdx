## Standard Threshold Alerts

Standard threshold alerts trigger when metrics cross defined boundaries, such as response time exceeding 500ms or error rate going above 5%.

### How It Works

You define specific threshold values, and Parseable monitors your data continuously. When the threshold is crossed, an alert is triggered.

### Use Cases

- **Error Rate Monitoring** - Alert when error rate exceeds a percentage
- **Latency Monitoring** - Alert when response times exceed acceptable limits
- **Resource Usage** - Alert when CPU, memory, or disk usage crosses thresholds

### Configuration

Set `alertType` to `threshold` when creating an alert and specify your threshold values.

See the [Alerts documentation](/docs/features/alerts) for detailed configuration options.
