## Anomaly Detection Alerts

Anomaly detection alerts use machine learning to automatically identify unusual patterns in your data without requiring manual threshold configuration.

### How It Works

Parseable analyzes your historical data to learn normal patterns and automatically detects deviations that may indicate issues.

### Benefits

- **No Manual Thresholds** - The system learns what's normal for your data
- **Adaptive** - Automatically adjusts to changing patterns
- **Early Detection** - Catch issues before they become critical

### Configuration

Set `alertType` to `anomaly` when creating an alert to enable anomaly detection.

See the [Alerts documentation](/docs/features/alerts) for detailed configuration options.
