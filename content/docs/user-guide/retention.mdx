Parseable allows setting the retention, or the amount of time that log data is kept in the system, for each dataset. The time can be set to a multiple of 1 day. Note that retention works at a dataset level, and each dataset can have a different retention period. Also, you can only set a single dataset per retention period.

## Setting up
You can set Retention via the Dataset Management page (Dataset >> Manage >> Retention). If you're using external applications to interact with Parseable, you can also use the retention API calls. Refer to the [API documentation](/docs/api) for details.

## Configuration
Here is sample retention configuration, with all the available options.


```json
[
    {
        "duration": "20d",
        "action": "delete",
        "description": "delete logs after 20 days"
    }
]
```

This table explains the configuration options.
