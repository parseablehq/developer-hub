## SQL Editor

Parseable provides a powerful SQL editor that allows you to query your log data using familiar SQL syntax.

### Features

- **Full SQL Support** - Use standard SQL queries to analyze your logs
- **Auto-completion** - Intelligent suggestions as you type
- **Query History** - Access your previous queries
- **Export Results** - Download query results in various formats

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the SQL Editor in the Parseable UI
2. Select your log stream from the dropdown
3. Write your SQL query
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Get recent logs
SELECT * FROM mystream LIMIT 100

-- Count logs by level
SELECT level, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM mystream 
GROUP BY level

-- Filter by time range
SELECT * FROM mystream 
WHERE p_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
```

### Tips

- Use `p_timestamp` for time-based filtering
- Use `LIMIT` to prevent large result sets
- Use `GROUP BY` for aggregations
