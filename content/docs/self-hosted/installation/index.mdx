Parseable is available in two variants: Distributed and Standalone. Each variant is tailored to meet different deployment needs, from small-scale testing environments to large-scale production systems.

While distributed deployment is recommended for production use, the standalone variant is ideal for quick setup and testing.

## Distributed 

<Callout type="info">
Parseable distributed cluster is recommended for production grade deployment. It requires an object store as persistent storage.
</Callout>

In a Distributed deployment, multiple Ingestion nodes work together to ingest data, allowing for better scalability and load distribution. This setup supports ingestion from either a single high-volume data source or multiple independent sources, making it the recommended choice for handling large data streams efficiently.

- [Docker Compose](./distributed/docker-compose)
- [Bare Metal and VMs](./distributed/linux)

## Standalone

<Callout type="info">
Parseable standalone server can be run with local store argument to use the disk attached on the machine as store. This is not recommended for production deployments.
</Callout>

The Standalone variant of the Parseable Observability Platform is designed for quick value realization, making it ideal for hobbyists and first-time users. In this mode Parseable operates with a single ingestion node, handling all data ingestion from various data sources. This setup is ideal for smaller workloads or testing environments where high availability and horizontal scaling are not primary concerns.
