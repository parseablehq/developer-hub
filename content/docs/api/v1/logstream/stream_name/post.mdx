          **Log Ingestion API via Stream Endpoint**  

          In this approach, you need to create a dataset first using the **Create
          Stream API**.  

          Once the dataset is created, you can send logs to the dataset ingestion
          API endpoint:  

          **http://INGESTION_ENDPOINT/api/v1/logstream/`stream_name`**  

          This API does not require any headers for specifying the dataset name.
