          **Log Ingestion API via Stream Endpoint**  

          In this approach, you need to create a stream first using the **Create
          Stream API**.  

          Once the stream is created, you can send logs to the stream ingestion
          API endpoint:  

          **http://INGESTION_ENDPOINT/api/v1/logstream/`stream_name`**  

          This API does not require any headers for specifying the stream name.
