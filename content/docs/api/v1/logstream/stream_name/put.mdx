          This endpoint is used to create a new log stream within Parseable.  

          A **log stream** is a group of similar logs. For example, you can
          create a log stream for a specific application's logs, another log
          stream for your database logs, and so on. You can create as many log
          streams as needed to organize and manage logs efficiently.
