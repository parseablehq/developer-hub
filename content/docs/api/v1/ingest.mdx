          **Log Ingestion API via Custom Headers**  

          This approach allows you to send logs to Parseable using custom
          headers to specify the target stream.  


          Required headers:

          - **X-PBL-Stream**: The name of the stream to ingest logs into


          The API accepts logs in JSON format. You can send single log entries
          or arrays of log entries.


          Example:

          ```json

          {
            "level": "info",
            "message": "User logged in",
            "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
            "user_id": "user123"
          }

          ```


          Or as an array:

          ```json

          [
            {
              "level": "info",
              "message": "User logged in",
              "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
              "user_id": "user123"
            },
            {
              "level": "error",
              "message": "Failed to process request",
              "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:01:00Z",
              "error_code": "ERR-1001"
            }
          ]

          ```
