## Zero Instrumentation

Parseable supports zero-instrumentation log collection, allowing you to capture logs from your applications without any code changes.

### Benefits

- **No Code Changes** - Start collecting logs immediately without modifying your application
- **Minimal Overhead** - Lightweight collection with minimal performance impact
- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any application that writes to stdout/stderr

### How It Works

Zero instrumentation leverages existing log outputs from your applications. By configuring log collectors to capture stdout/stderr streams, you can send logs to Parseable without adding any instrumentation libraries to your code.

### Getting Started

1. Deploy Parseable
2. Configure your log collector (Fluent Bit, Vector, etc.) to capture application logs
3. Point the collector to your Parseable endpoint
4. Start querying your logs

See the [Logging Agents](/docs/ingest-data/logs-ingestion/logging-agents) section for detailed setup guides.
