title: "OpenTelemetry Collector"
---

## Pre-requisites

- OTEL Collector installed on your target infrastructure. Refer the [OpenTelemetry Collector installation documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/) for installation instructions.
- Parseable installed on infrastructure of your choice. Refer the [Parseable installation documentation](/docs/installation/).

## Configuration
We'll use the OTLP receiver and the OTEL HTTP exporter to send logs to Parseable.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc: null
      http: null
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: '[PARSEABLE_URL]'
    headers:
      Authorization: '[BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN]'
      X-P-Log-Source: otel
      X-P-Stream: '[NAME_OF THE_STREAM_TO_SEND_LOGS_TO]'
      Content-Type: application/json
    encoding: json
    tls:
      insecure: true
processors:
  batch: null
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers:
        - otlp
      processors:
        - batch
      exporters:
        - otlphttp
```

The configuration above sets up the OTLP receiver to receive logs and the OTEL HTTP exporter to send logs to Parseable. The exporter configuration includes the Parseable endpoint, authorization headers, and the log source and dataset names.

Please ensure to change the `[PARSEABLE_URL]`, `[BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN]`, and `[NAME_OF THE_STREAM_TO_SEND_LOGS_TO]` placeholders with the actual values. The `[PARSEABLE_URL]` is the Parseable ingestor's endpoint to send logs to, like `http://ingestor.demo.parseable.com`. The `[BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN]` is the basic auth token to authenticate with Parseable. The `[NAME_OF THE_STREAM_TO_SEND_LOGS_TO]` is the name of the dataset in Parseable to send logs to.

### Start the OpenTelemetry Collector
After you have update the configuration file successfully (replaced the placeholders), start the OpenTelemetry Collector with the updated configuration file. For example, for a configuration file named `config.yaml` with OTEL Collector binary named `otel`, you can start the collector with the following command:

```bash
./otelcol --config ./config.yaml
```
Now the collector is running on HTTP port `4317` and gRPC port `4318`. By default, Parseable's `/v1/logs` endpoint is active, so it will ingest the logs directly.
