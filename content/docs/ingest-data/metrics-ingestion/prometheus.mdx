Parseable supports ingesting metrics from Prometheus using the remote write protocol. This allows you to use Parseable as a long-term storage backend for your Prometheus metrics.

## Configuration

To configure Prometheus to send metrics to Parseable, add the following to your Prometheus configuration file:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://<parseable-endpoint>:8000/api/v1/ingest"
    basic_auth:
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
    headers:
      X-P-Stream: prometheus-metrics
```

## Features

- **Long-term Storage**: Store your Prometheus metrics in Parseable for long-term retention and analysis.
- **SQL Queries**: Query your metrics using standard SQL syntax.
- **Cost Effective**: Leverage Parseable's efficient storage to reduce costs compared to traditional time-series databases.

## Best Practices

1. **Stream Naming**: Use descriptive stream names to organize your metrics by application or environment.
2. **Retention Policies**: Configure appropriate retention policies based on your compliance and analysis needs.
3. **Query Optimization**: Use appropriate time ranges and filters when querying large metric datasets.
