Connect Parseable to Looker for enterprise business intelligence and analytics.

## Overview

Integrate Parseable with Looker to:

- **Semantic Modeling** - Define metrics and dimensions with LookML
- **Self-Service Analytics** - Enable teams to explore data
- **Embedded Analytics** - Embed dashboards in applications
- **Governed Metrics** - Maintain consistent metric definitions

## Integration Options

<Callout type="info">
Parseable does not have a native Looker connector. Use one of the following methods to integrate.
</Callout>

### Option 1: Export Data via API

Export data from Parseable and load into a Looker-supported database:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Query Parseable
response = requests.post(
    "http://your-parseable-host:8000/api/v1/query",
    auth=("username", "password"),
    json={
        "query": "SELECT * FROM \"application-logs\" WHERE p_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'",
        "startTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "endTime": "2024-01-02T00:00:00Z"
    }
)

# Load into your data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)
df = pd.DataFrame(response.json())
# Then use your preferred method to load into the data warehouse
```

### Option 2: Use Apache Superset

For real-time connectivity to Parseable, we recommend using [Apache Superset](/docs/integrations/visualization/apache-superset) which has native Parseable support via the `sqlalchemy-parseable` driver.

### Option 3: Arrow Flight (Advanced)

Parseable exposes an Arrow Flight endpoint on port 8002 (`P_FLIGHT_PORT`) for high-performance data transfer. You can build a custom pipeline to fetch data via Arrow Flight and load into your Looker-connected data warehouse.

## Best Practices

1. **Schedule Data Exports** - Set up automated pipelines to export Parseable data to your data warehouse
2. **Use Incremental Loads** - Only export new data since the last sync
3. **Filter at Source** - Apply time range filters in Parseable queries to reduce data volume
4. **Consider Native Options** - For real-time dashboards, use [Apache Superset](/docs/integrations/visualization/apache-superset) or Parseable's built-in [dashboards](/docs/user-guide/dashboards)

## Next Steps

- Create [dashboards](/docs/user-guide/dashboards) in Parseable's built-in UI
- Set up [alerts](/docs/user-guide/alerting) for monitoring
- Explore [Apache Superset](/docs/integrations/visualization/apache-superset) for native integration
