### Overview
[Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) is a Kafka compatible streaming data platform. It is a drop-in replacement for Apache Kafka.

This document explains how to set up Redpanda, along with [Redpanda Connect](https://redpanda.com/docs/redpanda-connect) to send logs to Parseable using Docker Compose as the deployment platform. We assume here that you have producer applications that are sending logs/events to Redpanda.

### Prerequisites
Please ensure [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is installed on your machine.

### Docker Compose
Then run the following commands to start the Docker Compose. It will deploy Redpanda, Redpanda Console, and Parseable (standalone).

```bash
mkdir redpanda-parseable
wget https://www.parseable.com/docs/redpanda/docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Using the Redpanda Connect
Exec into the Redpanda instance by using the command:

```bash
docker exec -u root -it redpanda-0 /bin/bash
```
Once you are logged in, download the connect file using:

```bash
curl https://www.parseable.com/docs/redpanda/connect.yaml > connect.yaml
```
The `connect.yaml` file contains `input` and `output` configurations. Here Kafka is the input, i.e. we listen to a Kafka topic using Redpanda connect. The output is an HTTP Connector that will send data to Parseable. Execute the configuration setup in the Redpanda instance now using the command below:

```bash
rpk connect run connect.yaml
```
If correctly implemented, your terminal should show that the http_client is active and running! Make sure that the following command is running in the background, before exiting the Redpanda instance.

#### Send data to Redpanda topic
This step helps you test if everything is working as expected. In a production scenario, you'll have a log agent sending logs to the Redpanda topic.

Run the following commands to start a bash shell in the Redpanda container and post some sample data.

```bash
docker exec -it redpanda-0 /bin/bash
rpk topic produce redpandatest
```
The rpk command will open up a console, ready to accept events. Then paste the below data in the terminal.


```bash

```
You can now check the Parseable dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`, you should see this data in the dashboard.
