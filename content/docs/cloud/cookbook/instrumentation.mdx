## Instrumentation Guide

Learn how to properly instrument your applications for effective observability with Parseable.

### Structured Logging

Always use structured logging formats like JSON:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "User logged in",
  "user_id": "user-123",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "duration_ms": 45
}
```

### Key Fields to Include

- **timestamp** - When the event occurred
- **level** - Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
- **message** - Human-readable description
- **correlation_id** - For tracing requests across services
- **service** - Name of the service generating the log

### Best Practices

1. Use consistent field names across services
2. Include context with every log entry
3. Avoid logging sensitive data
4. Use appropriate log levels
5. Include timing information for performance analysis

### Integration Examples

See the [Logging Agents](/docs/ingest-data/logs-ingestion/logging-agents) and [OpenTelemetry](/docs/ingest-data/logs-ingestion/opentelemetry) sections for integration guides.
