## Agentic Observability

Learn how to monitor AI agents and LLM-powered applications with Parseable.

### Overview

As AI agents become more prevalent, observability becomes critical for understanding their behavior, debugging issues, and ensuring reliability.

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Token Usage** - Monitor input/output tokens per request
- **Latency** - Track response times for LLM calls
- **Error Rates** - Monitor failed requests and retries
- **Cost** - Track API costs across different models

### Best Practices

1. Log all LLM interactions with full context
2. Track tool calls and their outcomes
3. Monitor agent decision paths
4. Set up alerts for anomalous behavior
