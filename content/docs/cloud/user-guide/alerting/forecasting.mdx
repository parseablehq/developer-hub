## Forecasting Alerts

We predict future data and alert you if it's expected to cross your limit.

### Configuration

- **Use historical data of**: Historical period for prediction model (e.g., 1 day, 1 week)
- **Repeat evaluation every**: How often to run predictions (e.g., every 10 minutes)
- **Forecast the next**: Time window to predict ahead (e.g., 3 hours, 1 day)
- **Group By behavior**: When using Group By with Forecasting, the system analyzes each group independently. Alerts trigger separately for each group that shows anomalous behavior. You can preview anomalies for individual groups using the dropdown selector in the top-right corner of the preview panel.
