Parseable is an observability platform built to make sense of large volumes of telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces). It is easy to deploy and use, and scales to petabytes of data ingested, queried and analyzed.

SRE and DevOps teams use Parseable to build observability pipelines and data lakes for their telemetry data. With built-in support for predictive alerting and anomaly detection, Parseable helps teams proactively monitor their complete stack.

Parseable is based on purpose built, disk-less database [ParseableDB](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable). It uses columnar storage format with an object storage first approach, making it efficient for both storage and query performance. ParseableDB is built with Rust, leveraging modern programming techniques to achieve high performance and low resource usage.
