<p>Parseable is a <strong>modern, unified observability platform</strong>. SRE and DevOps teams use Parseable to build observability pipelines to observe their production systems at scale.</p>

<p>Parseable ingests, processes, stores, and queries telemetry data including logs, metrics, and traces from applications, infrastructure, and services.</p>

<p>With built-in support for predictive alerting and anomaly detection, Parseable helps teams proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact end-users.</p>

<p>It is based on our <a href="https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable">purpose built telemetry data lake</a>. Written in Rust, Parseable uses advanced compression and caching techniques to offer best in class performance and scalability.</p>
