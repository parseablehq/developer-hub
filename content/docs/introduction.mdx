Parseable is fast, efficient, unified observability platform.

At the core of Parseable is purpose built, disk-less database [ParseableDB](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable). ParseableDB is built ground up on the principles of simplicity, performance and efficiency. It is designed to handle large volumes of telemetry data, like logs, metrics, and traces, with a focus on efficient data ingestion, storage and fast querying.

ParseableDB integrates natively with the observability first frontend called Prism. Combined, ParseableDB and Prism provide a powerful platform for observability and telemetry data.
