<p>Parseable is a <u>modern, unified observability platform</u>. It is based on our <u>purpose built telemetry data lake</u>. Written in Rust, Parseable uses advanced compression and caching techniques to offer best in class performance and scalability.</p>

SRE and DevOps teams use Parseable to build observability pipelines to observe their production systems at scale. Parseable ingests, stores, and queries logs, metrics, and traces from applications, infrastructure, and services.

With built-in support for predictive alerting and anomaly detection, Parseable helps teams proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact end-users.

Parseable is based on purpose built telemetry data lake that uses object storage as the primary storage layer. With columnar storage format, Parseable is efficient for both storage and query performance.
