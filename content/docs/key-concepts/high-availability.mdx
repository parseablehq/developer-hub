  <EnterpriseBadge /> Prism, Distributed Query and Indexor nodes are Enterprise-only features and cannot be deployed with OSS versions.
</Callout>

Parseable supports a distributed, high-availability mode for production use cases where downtime is not an option. The distributed setup is designed to ensure fault tolerance and high availability for log ingestion.

The distributed setup consists of multiple ingestion and query server and a S3 (or other object store) bucket. 

The Query servers use metadata stored in the object store to query the data. The query server uses the Parseable manifest file and the Parquet footers in tandem to ensure that the data is read in fewest possible object store API calls.

## Architecture

Parseable distributed mode is based on a completely decoupled design with clear segregation between the compute and storage. Different components like the ingestor and querier, are on independent paths, and can be scaled independently.

### Minimum Requirements

A production-ready high availability deployment requires at minimum:
- 1 Prism node
- 1 Querier node
- 1 Ingestor node
- 1 Indexor node (for search functionality)

It's recommended to keep at least one ingestor node live at all times to ensure continuous data ingestion, even during maintenance or upgrades.

### Node Functions

- **Prism Node**: Handles the Parseable UI and all user requests except for query and search operations. The Prism node is designed to be as compute efficient as the querier node.

- **Querier Node**: Processes data queries and analytics. Queriers use metadata stored in the object store to efficiently read data with minimal API calls.

- **Ingestor Node**: Processes incoming log events. Each ingestor creates its own set of metadata and data files in the object storage system, allowing for simple scaling as workloads change.

- **Indexor Node**: Manages indexing and search functionality.

## High Availability

Parseable Enterprise builds upon the distributed architecture of Parseable OSS, enhancing it with an even more robust high availability framework. This feature allows you to independently scale the query nodes along with the independently scalable ingest nodes.

The high availability architecture in Parseable Enterprise consists of four specialized node types, each serving a distinct function within the cluster:

### Node specific Environment variables 

| Node Type | Role | Scalability | Node specific Env var |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prism (Leader) | Manages UI, dataset configuration, and RBAC | Single Node | - |
| Query | Handles data querying and analytics | Independently scalable | P_QUERIER_ENDPOINT |
| Ingest | Processes incoming log event | Independently scalable | P_INGESTOR_ENDPOINT |
| Index | Manages indexing and search | Single Node (multi node planned) | P_INDEXER_ENDPOINT |

Details of the environment variables are available in the [Environment Variables](/docs/env-variables).

Each node in the cluster generates and maintains its own NodeMetadata file containing domain name information, authentication tokens, and node-specific configuration. These metadata files are stored in the configured S3 bucket and serve as the foundation for inter-node communication.

For optimal performance, we recommend the following specifications for each node type:

| Node Type | vCPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prism (leader) | 16 | 32 GiB |
| Query | 16 | 32 GiB |
| Ingest | 8 | 16 GiB |
| Index | 16 | 32 GiB |

> **Prism Node**: The Prism node requires similar compute and storage resources as the querier node because it handles all user interface operations and administrative requests. 

## Migration Paths

### Standalone to Distributed

If you're already running Parseable in standalone mode and want to migrate to distributed mode, follow these steps:

1. Stop the existing standalone server
2. Add the environment variable `P_MODE=Prism` to configure the node as a Prism node
3. Start the server in distributed mode

The server will automatically migrate the metadata and other relevant manifest files to the distributed mode. After setting up the Prism node, you can add additional nodes (querier, ingestor, indexor) to complete your distributed deployment.

### Parseable OSS to Enterprise

If you're currently running Parseable OSS in distributed mode, the migration process is straightforward:

1. Deploy a new Prism node using the Parseable Enterprise image/binary
2. Configure the Prism node to use the same S3 bucket as your existing deployment
3. Start the Prism node
4. Start an Index node for search capabilities

Your existing OSS nodes will automatically be incorporated into the Enterprise cluster with no additional configuration required.

This is a one-way and one-time process. It is not possible to move from a distributed deployment back to a standalone deployment.
