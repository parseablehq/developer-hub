Partitioning allows splitting of telemetry based on specific columns and value pairs to improve query performance. The decision to choose specific columns for partitioning is based on the access patterns of the data. By partitioning log data, you can optimize query performance, reduce the amount of data scanned during queries, and improve storage efficiency.

## When to use partitioning?

Partitioning is useful when you have a clear understanding of the most common data access patterns for a given log dataset. More specifically, when the columns where users are most likely to `filter` or `group by` are well known.

Also, a relatively larger dataset (at least few TBs or more) is better suited for partitioning. For tiny datasets, the overhead of managing partitions might outweigh the benefits.

## Select a column for partitioning

The first step is to find which column users are most likely to `filter` or `group by`. Once you have this information, it is important to know the variance in the column values (i.e. the number of unique values in the column). For example, if you have a column `log_level` with only a few unique values like `ERR`, `WARN`, and `INFO`, it would be a good candidate for partitioning. But if there is a column called `log_message` where each log event has a unique message, partitioning on this column will in fact make things worse.

**Important**: In Parseable, you can select only one column per dataset for partitioning.

## How to set up partitioning?

You can specify a single column for partitioning while creating a dataset on the Parseable Console (Create Dataset >> Custom Partition Field). Once the dataset is created, Parseable will automatically create physical partitions based on the values in this column.

You can also edit the partition column for an existing dataset (Dataset >> Manage >> Info >> Custom Partition Field). Note that this will have effect on all the new data that is ingested into the dataset, and not the existing data.

## How does partitioning work?

When a dataset is created with partitioning enabled, Parseable will create physical partitions based on the values in the specified column. For example, if you have a column `log_level` with the values `ERR`, `WARN`, and `INFO`, Parseable will create three physical partitions, one for each value.

When a query is run with a filter on `log_level`, Parseable will only scan the relevant partition(s) and not the entire dataset. This significantly reduces the amount of data scanned during queries and improves query performance.

Let's understand this better with an example. Let's say you have log events with columns `timestamp`, `log_level`, `service_name`, `log_message` and `os`. If one of the most common data query patterns is to filter events by `log_level` (i.e., most queries are of the form `select * from logs where log_level = '...'`), then you should consider partitioning by the `log_level` column.

Physically on the storage (S3 bucket or disk), you'll see the data organized by the partition column values. For example, if you have partitioning on `log_level`, you'll see the data organized like this:

```sql
  log_level=ERR
  log_level=WARN
  log_level=INFO
```

If you frequently filter by both `log_level` and another column like `os`, you'll need to decide which one provides the most query benefit as your partition column, since only one column can be used for partitioning.

## Best practices

- **Choose the right column:** Choose the column that is most frequently used in query filters.

- **Understand the data distribution:** Ensure that the column you choose has a good distribution of values with relatively low cardinality (few unique values).

- **Avoid high cardinality columns:** Partitioning on a column with high cardinality (i.e., many unique values) can lead to too many small partitions, which is inefficient.

- **Consider query patterns:** Select a partition column that aligns with your most common query filters.

- **Monitor and adjust:** Monitor the query performance and adjust the partition column as needed if query patterns change.
