title: Storage
---

Parseable is fundamentally **object store-first**: every byte that flows through the platform is persisted in cloud storage, enabling infinite scalability and cost-effective long-term retention.

## Storage Architecture

Parseable uses Apache Arrow and Parquet as its underlying data structures, optimized for analytical workloads. This columnar format provides:

- **Compression efficiency**: Significantly reduced storage costs
- **Query performance**: Fast analytical queries over compressed data
- **Schema evolution**: Flexible data structure changes over time
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Standard format readable by many tools

## Supported Storage Providers

Parseable supports multiple cloud storage providers and S3-compatible services:

### Cloud Providers
- **AWS S3**: Native integration with all AWS regions
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Full support for Azure storage accounts
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Compatible through S3 API

### S3-Compatible Services
- **MinIO**: Self-hosted object storage
- **Wasabi**: Cost-optimized cloud storage
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**: Developer-friendly object storage
- **Backblaze B2**: Affordable cloud storage

## Authentication Models

Parseable supports multiple authentication mechanisms to fit different deployment scenarios:

### Static Credentials
- Access keys and secret keys for direct authentication
- Suitable for development and simple deployments
- Requires careful credential management

### Dynamic Credentials
- **IAM Roles**: For AWS EC2/ECS deployments
- **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**: Automatic credential rotation
- **Container Credentials**: For containerized environments
- **Azure AD Integration**: Service principal authentication

### Security Features
- **Encryption at Rest**: Support for server-side encryption (SSE)
- **Customer-Managed Keys**: SSE-C for custom encryption keys
- **TLS in Transit**: Secure data transmission
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions through cloud IAM

## Data Organization

Parseable organizes data in object storage using a hierarchical structure:

```
bucket/
├── streams/
│   ├── app-logs/
│   │   ├── year=2024/
│   │   │   ├── month=01/
│   │   │   │   ├── day=15/
│   │   │   │   │   └── data.parquet
│   └── system-logs/
└── metadata/
    └── schemas/
```

### Partitioning Strategy
- **Time-based partitioning**: Efficient querying by time ranges
- **Stream isolation**: Separate storage per log stream
- **Metadata separation**: Schema and configuration data stored separately

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput Management
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Concurrent uploads**: Parallel data ingestion
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents overwhelming storage APIs
- **Retry mechanisms**: Automatic handling of transient failures

### Cost Optimization
- **Compression**: Parquet format reduces storage costs by 80-90%
- **Lifecycle policies**: Automatic data archiving and deletion
- **Regional optimization**: Data stored in optimal regions
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Minimal data transfer overhead

## Reliability and Durability

### Built-in Resilience
- **Multi-region replication**: Available through cloud provider features
- **Automatic backups**: Leverages cloud storage durability (99.999999999%)
- **Consistency guarantees**: Strong consistency for all operations
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive retry and fallback mechanisms

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Storage metrics**: Track usage, costs, and performance
- **Health checks**: Continuous storage connectivity monitoring
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of storage issues

## Integration Benefits

### Ecosystem Compatibility
- **Analytics tools**: Direct querying with tools like Apache Spark, Presto
- **Data lakes**: Seamless integration with existing data infrastructure
- **Backup solutions**: Standard formats enable easy data migration
- **Compliance**: Leverage cloud provider compliance certifications

### Operational Advantages
- **Zero maintenance**: No storage infrastructure to manage
- **Infinite scale**: Automatic scaling with usage
- **Global availability**: Deploy anywhere with cloud presence
- **Cost transparency**: Pay only for what you store and transfer
