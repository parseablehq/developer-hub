## Real-World Performance: 100 TB/Day

We tested Parseable's performance with a real-world scenario of ingesting **100 TB of telemetry data per day**.

### Test Results at a Glance

| Metric                | Result                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Ingestion Rate**    | **2 TB/hour** (sustained)            |
| **Query Latency**     | **Millisecond-range** (even at load) |
| **Monthly Cost**      | **~$11,810** (for a 4-node cluster)  |
| **Compression Ratio** | **Up to 90%**                        |

### Test Environment

*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS
*   **Ingestion Nodes:** 4 x c5n.2xlarge EC2 instances
*   **Storage:** AWS S3

## Architectural Highlights

Parseable's performance is a result of its modern architecture, designed for observability data:

*   **Diskless Architecture:** Separates compute and storage, using object storage for scalability.
*   **Columnar Storage:** High compression and fast queries.
*   **On-Demand Indexing:** Reduces indexing overhead.
*   **Stateless Nodes:** For horizontal scaling.
*   **Vectorized Query Execution:** Efficient CPU usage.
*   **Built in Rust:** For a small memory footprint.
